    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p> As you can probably tell our website is currently under construction so right now there is not much you can do. <br>
        Our goal is to create a platform where everyone can share their art/pictures/memes/ and so on.<br>
        </p><br>
    <h1>The Team</h1>
    <p> Our Team currently consists of two people.<br>
        The first one is Richard. He is our designer. Most of the things you will see on our website is likely made by him. <br>
        Then there is me, Fabian. The guy that manages the coding stuff behind all this. Every button, text or dynamic element you see on this website <br>
        is made by me (with some help from friends of course :) ).<br>
